# hello-world
This repository will store info and files for my first Github exercise!
My name is Luke! I am just starting to learn coding as part of my Geographic Information Systems education. 
I like spicy tacos and riding mountain bikes in the woods! I prefer to have my tacos after a long ride along with a cold beer.
